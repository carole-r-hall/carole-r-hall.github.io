The term _Procrustean_ describes something that ignores differences or special circumstances, or something known to enforce uniformity without flexibility. Greek mythology has stories of a bandit from Attica by the name of Procrustes (also called Prokoptas, Damastes, or Polypemon) who stretched or cut limbs off of people in an effort to get them to fit into an iron bed. Hence, why Procrustean now means the quality of forcing things to fit a desired mould, often without remorse or consideration. Procrustes was a son of Poseidon, and had a bed which he would offer to travelers coming through the road between Athens and Eleusis ("the sacred way"). Travelers who stayed in his bed were stretched if they were shorter than the bed, or their legs were cut off if they were larger than the bed, and no one ever was the perfect size. In fact, in Edgar Allan Poe referenced the Procrustean bed in his short story ["The Purloined Letter"](https://poestories.com/read/purloined), describing the firm method of investigation performed by the Parisian police.

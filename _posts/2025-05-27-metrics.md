When we first learn about geometry, we learn how to measure the distance between two points on the plane; draw a line between the two points, and measure the length of that line. However, when you're no longer on a nice, flat plane, what happens?

If we think of two points $\boldsymbol{X}$ and $\boldsymbol{Y}$ as existing on the flat plane shown above, it's easy to imagine drawing a straight line between them. We know how to calculate the distance of that line. say $\boldsymbol{X} = \left(x_1, x_2\right)$ and $\boldsymbol{Y} = \left(y_1, y_2\right)$. This distance is the Euclidean distance:

$$
d\left(\boldsymbol{X}, \boldsymbol{Y}\right) = \sqrt{\left(x_1 - y_1\right)^2 +\left(x_2 - y_2\right)^2}
$$

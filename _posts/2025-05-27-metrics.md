# Metric spaces

When we first learn about geometry, we learn how to measure the distance between two points on the plane; draw a line between the two points, and measure the length of that line. However, when you're no longer on a nice, flat plane, what happens?

If we think of two points $\boldsymbol{X}$ and $\boldsymbol{Y}$ as existing on the flat plane shown above, it's easy to imagine drawing a straight line between them. We know how to calculate the distance of that line. say $\boldsymbol{X} = \left(x_1, x_2\right)$ and $\boldsymbol{Y} = \left(y_1, y_2\right)$. This distance is the Euclidean distance:

$$
d\left(\boldsymbol{X}, \boldsymbol{Y}\right) = \sqrt{\left(x_1 - y_1\right)^2 +\left(x_2 - y_2\right)^2}
$$

How do we define the distance between two points if they lie on the Swiss roll shown above, or worse, what if our points aren't even visualizable (e.g., it's in some messy high-dimensionl space)? **Metric spaces** have a built-in _metric_, or way to calculate the distance between two points lying in a metric space. 

## The magic of metrics

A **metric** is a function that tells you the distance between two points in space. Formally, a metric on some set $\boldsymbol{X}$, denoted $d: \boldsymbol{X}\times\boldsymbol{X} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ is a function such that for any points $x,y,z\in\boldsymbol{X}$ we have:
- **Non-negativity**: $d(x,y)\geq{0}$
- **Identity of discernibles a.ka. Leibniz's Law**: $d(x,y) = 0 \Longleftrightarrow x = y$
- **Symmetry**: $d(x,y) = d(y,x)$
- **Triangle inequality**: $d(x,z) \leq d(x,y) + d(y,z)$

A classic example of a metric space we see all the time is the Euclidean space $\mathbb{R}^n$ (real numbers of $n$ dimensions) with the usual Euclidean distance formula. 

### What do non-metric spaces look like?

The nice thing about a metric space is we will surely know, always, that we can meaningfully talk about distances, and that our notion of distance will always be consistent. In non-metric spaces, we can sometimes still talk about distance; for example, a **pseudometric** space is one that satisfies $d(x,x) = 0$ but has the caveat that $d(x,y) = 0$ does _not_ imply that $x = y$. This is the case in some spaces where euquality is defined up to some equivalence. There's a good example of a pseudometric space given [here](https://planetmath.org/exampleofpseudometricspace), where the pseudometric is given as 

$$
d((x_1,x_2), (y_1, y_2)) = \|x_1 - y_1\|
$$

And we have an example of two different points being of distance 0 from one another:

$$
d((2,3), (2,5)) = \|2 - 2\| = 0
$$

Hence, this is _not_ a full metric space. 

There are also **quasimetric** spaces which don't have symmetry. I.e., $d(x,y) \neq d(y,x)$. Real examples of these include directed graphs and time-delay systems. There are **semimetric** spaces as well, satisfying all but the triangle inequality. I liked reading [this discussion](https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/971068/give-3-different-examples-of-semi-metric-spaces-which-are-not-metric-spaces) on semimetric space examples, so check that out if you want to think more about that. 

### Back to metric spaces

Why do we need to generalize past the familiarity of $\mathbb{R}^n$? Not all spaces we want to work in are flat; consider some easy to conceptualize spaces first, like the Earth (a sphere). If you wanted to know how many miles it takes to get from point $A$ to point $B$, you could approximate this by drawing a straight line between them; however, as shown below, you can't move through the earth&mdash;you have to travel along the arc at the surface. At small distances, say between two adjacent towns, approximating the arc distance by the linear distance isn't a bad approximation. However, if we want to measure the distance between two points that are very far, say, not even on the same continent, the error between these two distance measures would be substantial.

For less intuitive spaces (some might call these spaces more _interesting_, perhaps...) points may represent something more than just coordinates on a map&mdash;they may be shapes, functions, images, or entire distributions. How do we even say whether two shapes are different or similar quantitatively? Distance from our metric allows us to use a real number to judge differences and similarities between seemingly vague objects. 

## Manifolds

Now that we've established what a metric space is (i.e., some set that has a distance function associated with it satisfying the four properties we went over earlier) we can get into the concept of **manifolds**. A manifold is a space that may be curved globablly, but locally looks like our usual $\mathbb{R}^n$ (i.e., flat). Formally, we define an $n$-dimensional manifold as a topological space that's locally homeomorphic to $\mathbb{R}^n$. Two spaces are **homeomorphic** if there exists a continuous, bijective map between them whose inverse is also continuous. Check [this article](https://www.cuemath.com/algebra/bijective-function/) if you'd like a refresher/intro on bijective maps. We also call the spaces _topologically equivalent_ in this case&mdash;they may look different geometrically (e.g. the difference between a donut and a coffee mug; see a review about this topological example [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxAwhW4gP_c); however, features we care about topologically are preserved when bending and stretching to turn one into another (like how continuity works in the spaces). 

When we say a manifold is _locally_ homeomorphic to $\mathbb{R}^n$, we mean that while the whole space may be kind of twisty in a global sense, when we zoom in super close on a local patch, this behaves like a flat Euclidean space that we know and love. The local flatness allows us to import familiar tools in calculus like derivatives, tangent vecotrs, and so on, even though the global space can be highly nonlinear. 

## Riemannian metrics

A **Riemannian metric** gives a smooth manifold a way to measure lengths, angles, and distances. It assigns an inner product to each tangent space of the manifold. Think back to our visual of the sphere above&mdash;we drew a straight line to connect two points lying on the surface of our sphere to approximate the distance, while the true distance is represented by the length of the arc connecting them along the surface. The tangent space of a manifold is where we do our linear approximations; think of us sticking a notecard to a basketball, and the notecard is then the tangent space to the basketball; or see below for a better idea:

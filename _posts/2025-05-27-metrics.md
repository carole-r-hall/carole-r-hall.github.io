# Metric spaces

When we first learn about geometry, we learn how to measure the distance between two points on the plane; draw a line between the two points, and measure the length of that line. However, when you're no longer on a nice, flat plane, what happens?

If we think of two points $\boldsymbol{X}$ and $\boldsymbol{Y}$ as existing on the flat plane shown above, it's easy to imagine drawing a straight line between them. We know how to calculate the distance of that line. say $\boldsymbol{X} = \left(x_1, x_2\right)$ and $\boldsymbol{Y} = \left(y_1, y_2\right)$. This distance is the Euclidean distance:

$$
d\left(\boldsymbol{X}, \boldsymbol{Y}\right) = \sqrt{\left(x_1 - y_1\right)^2 +\left(x_2 - y_2\right)^2}
$$

How do we define the distance between two points if they lie on the Swiss roll shown above, or worse, what if our points aren't even visualizable (e.g., it's in some messy high-dimensionl space)? **Metric spaces** have a built-in _metric_, or way to calculate the distance between two points lying in a metric space. 

## The magic of metrics

A **metric** is a function that tells you the distance between two points in space. Formally, a metric on some set $\boldsymbol{X}$, denoted $d: \boldsymbol{X}\times\boldsymbol{X} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ is a function such that for any points $x,y,z\in\boldsymbol{X}$ we have:
- **Non-negativity**: $d(x,y)\geq{0}$
- **Identity of discernibles a.ka. Leibniz's Law**: $d(x,y) = 0 \Longleftrightarrow x = y$
- **Symmetry**: $d(x,y) = d(y,x)$
- **Triangle inequality**: $d(x,z) \leq d(x,y) + d(y,z)$

The nice thing about a metric space is we will surely know, always, that we can meaningfully talk about distances, and that our notion of distance will always be consistent. In non-metric spaces, we can sometimes still talk about distance; for example, a **pseudometric** space is one that satisfies $d(x,x) = 0$ but has the caveat that $d(x,y) = 0$ does _not_ imply that $x = y$. This is the case in some spaces where euquality is defined up to some equivalence. There's a good example of a pseudometric space given [here](https://planetmath.org/exampleofpseudometricspace), where the pseudometric is given as 

$$
d((x_1,x_2), (y_1, y_2)) = \|x_1 - y_1\|
$$

And we have an example of two different points being of distance 0 from one another:

$$
d((2,3), (2,5)) = \|2 - 2\| = 0
$$

Hence, this is _not_ a full metric space.
